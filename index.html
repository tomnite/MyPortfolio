                        <p>Originally from Crewe, Virginia, a town of about 2,000 people in South Central Virginia, I graduated from Nottoway High School, 13th out of a class of 169.  Then I went to James Madison University and earned my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology.  Upon graduation from JMU, I moved to Key West, Florida, and lived there for 5.5 years, mostly working in restaurants and bars, and dabbling in construction, before enrolling in a Master's Degree Program at Troy State University to study Counseling Psychology.  After enrolling in the program, I soon realized that it would be extraordinarily difficult to complete my degree and obtain employment in my field of study if I remained in Key West, so I moved to Orlando, where Troy State University had another extension campus.  In January of 1998, I began my career in Behavioral Healthcare, working as a case manager at Human Services Associates, Inc. (HSA), in Orlando.</p>

                        <p>In 1999, I completed my Masters of Science in Counseling Psychology and was soon promoted to Program Manager.  In 2003, I left HSA to accept a position at Devereux as a Quality and Compliance Specialist.  In less than 2 years I was promoted to be the Director of Devereux's Osceola County Service Center.  In 2006, I left Devereux and accepted a position back at HSA as the Director of Outpatient Adolescent Substance Abuse Services.  I remained at HSA for another 9 years until HSA lost its contract with its major funder and closed its doors, at which point, I was hired by Devereux to be the Program Manager for 4 programs, BNet, Foster Home Licensing and Placement, Therapeutic Foster Care, and Family Care.  Currently, I am still working in this position and I am now embarking on a quest for a career change, beginning with my enrollment in the UCF Coding Bootcamp.</p>
